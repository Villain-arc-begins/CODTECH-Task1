# Password Strength Checker  

## Internship Details  
- **Name**: Mohammad Salman Salahutheen  
- **Company**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
- **ID**: CT6WEFH  
- **Domain**: Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking  
- **Duration**: December 17th, 2024, to February 2nd, 2025  
- **Mentor**: N. Santhosh  

## Overview of the Project  
This project is a **Password Strength Checker**, designed to evaluate the strength of a given password based on several key factors, such as length, variety of character types, and use of special characters. It calculates a password strength score and provides feedback on whether the password is weak, average, or strong.  

## Objective  
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple yet effective tool for users to assess their password strength, promoting better cybersecurity practices by encouraging strong passwords. Weak passwords are a significant vulnerability, and this tool aims to make users more aware of the elements that contribute to a secure password.  

## Key Features  

### 1. Character Type Analysis  
- Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.  
- Assigns points based on the diversity of character types used.  

### 2. Length Analysis  
- Evaluates the password length and assigns points for exceeding thresholds (e.g., 8, 12, 14, 16 characters).  

### 3. Scoring System  
- Combines character type diversity and length to compute a total strength score (out of 7).  

### 4. User Feedback  
- Provides descriptive feedback on the password's strength (weak, average, good, strong) based on the score.  

## How It Works  

### Input  
A password string is provided for evaluation.  

### Character Checks  
- Determines if the password contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.  

### Scoring  
- Assigns points for length and diversity of character types.  

### Feedback  
- Displays the password strength score and descriptive feedback on its quality.  

## Example Output  

For a password `HELLOWORLd23@won!weak`:  
- Password length is **23**, adding **4 points**.  
- Password has **4 different character types**, adding **3 points**.  
- **Total score**: 7/7.  
- **Feedback**: "The password is Strong! Score: 7 / 7".  

## Project Motivation  
This project was developed as part of a cybersecurity initiative to educate users about the importance of strong passwords. By providing clear and actionable feedback, the tool empowers users to create more secure passwords, reducing the risk of password-related vulnerabilities.  

## Contribution  
Feel free to contribute by:  
- Adding more evaluation criteria.  
- Enhancing the scoring algorithm.  
- Improving the user feedback system.
